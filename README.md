# Tic Tac Toe Game with React App
This is the third project of the Internet engineering course that I have written with React and also this is my first experience in React. I used create-react-app for creating the app

## What is Tic Tac Toe
Tic-tac-toe is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner. It is a solved game with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.
